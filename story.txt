One day Bob woke up. He put on some clothes and went to the store. He had a lot of things he needed to buy.

Bob was planning a party. He needed to buy lots of snacks. At the store, he purchased 4 bags of chips, 2 jars of salsa, and 3 pints of ice cream.

After he went back home, his mother was angry because Bob did not finish the homework and buy many snacks.

But, at least Bob was full of delicious treats. The snacks were fantastic, but now he needs to work on his
computer science homework with his Xteam.

After hours of hard work, Bob was able to finish all of his homework. Bob's mother was so pleased that she 
let him throw is party that night! Bob and all of his friends partied the night away, and Bob got an A in
cs400. 

Bob would later be diagnosed with ALS, a degenerative disease that causes the sufferer to lose control of
his body, until eventually leading to death. As Bob sat in his wheelchair in the days before he died, he
would think back to the days of xteam assignments and partying and ponder, "If I had known how things 
would end up, would I have done anything differently? Is this really all my life was meant for?"

A few days later, Bob lay dying in his hospital bed, surrounded only by a nurse's assistant and the cold, 
buzzing machines that had been keeping him alive. As he took his last breath, he thought about how god 
could allow something so terrible to happen to him. What had Bob done to deserve this fate? Bob had always 
tried to be a good person, but in the end it made no difference. Bob concluded that there must be no god, 
or at least he decided he would rather believe that than believe that god could be so cruel. As Bob closed 
his eyes for the last time, he frantically remembered, "Oh no! I think I left the oven on!"
