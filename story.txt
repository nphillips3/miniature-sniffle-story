One day Bob woke up. He put on some clothes and went to the store. He had a lot of things he needed to buy.

Bob was planning a party. He needed to buy lots of snacks. At the store, he purchased 4 bags of chips, 2 jars of salsa, and 3 pints of ice cream.

After he went back home, his mother was angry because Bob did not finish the homework and buy many snacks.

But, at least Bob was full of delicious treats. The snacks were fantastic, but now he needs to work on his
computer science homework with his Xteam.
